'''Exercise
Create a function to evaluate IMU and suggest an action
Here is a list of products and how much they cost the store to buy
Jean_cost = 25.00
Shirt_cost = 15.00
Shoe_cost = 10.00

Here is a list of what they are being sold for
Jean_price = 60.00
Shirt_price = 20.00
Shoe_price = 11.00

We want to keep our margins begween 2% and 14% Create a function that evaluates the cost and the sell price
If it is over 14% bring back directions to markdown
If it is under 2% bring back directions to markup
If it is in range bring back directions to keep same

# EXERCISE:
# Write a function that takes two parameters (hours and rate), and returns the total pay.

# Total pay
