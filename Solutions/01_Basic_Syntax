# Exercise Basic Math functions
# Create your own basic math function  mixing text and the math problem

#Mean - add up all the numbers in a data set and dived by the numbers
# Data set numbers 1,2,3,4,5,6,7
1+2+3+4+5+6+7
28/7

# Create a boolean function that brings back the text of what you are testing 
# and has an answer of False

28/7 <2



# Finish the code EXERCISE
# Lets add some math in our variables with the above code

#VARIABLES
departments = 100.00
headcount_by_dept = 15.00
managers = 92.00
employees = 1498.00
managers_needed = departments
total_headcount = (departments * headcount_by_dept)+ managers_needed

# total_headcount minus (managers plus employees)
total_headcount_available= managers + employees
print total_headcount
# employee divided by department

avg_employee_per_dept = (departments/employees)*100

# Create a print statement that tells you how many managers are needed, what 
# the total headcount is, the headcount available 
# and the average employee per department.
print "The number of managers we need is:", managers_needed, "Our headcount is", total_headcount,
"The average employee per department is", avg_employee_per_dept
