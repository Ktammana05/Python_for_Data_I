# Exercise Basic Math functions
# Create your own basic math function  mixing text and the math problem

#Mean - add up all the numbers in a data set and dived by the numbers
# Data set numbers 1,2,3,4,5,6,7
1+2+3+4+5+6+7
28/7

# Create a boolean function that brings back the text of what you are testing 
# and has an answer of False

28/7 <2



# Finish the code EXERCISE
# Lets add some math in our variables with the above code

#VARIABLES
departments = 100.00
headcount_by_dept = 15.00
managers = 92.00
employees = 1498.00
managers_needed = departments
total_headcount = (departments * headcount_by_dept)+ managers_needed

# total_headcount minus (managers plus employees)
total_headcount_available= managers + employees
print total_headcount
# employee divided by department

avg_employee_per_dept = (departments/employees)*100

# Create a print statement that tells you how many managers are needed, what 
# the total headcount is, the headcount available 
# and the average employee per department.
print "The number of managers we need is:", managers_needed, "Our headcount is", total_headcount,
"The average employee per department is", avg_employee_per_dept

''' EXERCISE
Initial Markup (IMU) is the difference between the cost and selling price of 
an item when it is first introduced for sale.  The formula for this calculation is: 
Selling price â€“ cost = Initial Markup Dollars. 
To calculate the IMU% it is (Selling price - Cost) / Cost *100
If a buyer brings in a line of jeans with a cost of 25 per pair and initially 
prices them to sell at 55 per pair, the Initial Markup is 30. 
*Create an IMU calculator''' 

cost = 10.00
price = 15.00
IMU = price-cost
IMU_percent= ((price-cost)/cost) *100
print "The cost is", cost,"the price is:", price,"The IMU is:",IMU, 
print "The IMU percent is",IMU_percent
