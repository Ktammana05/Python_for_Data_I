# Python for Data I Workshop
This workshop is meant to help someone break into programming using Python and data. The material covered is in a crash course fashion 
and is by no means comprehensive. The materials covered are a "best of". 

It is up to an individual to work with other courses outside of this workshop in order to get a full breadth of knowledge.  If you have not already heard of these resources and are new to python I would use them in conjunction with what you learn here as they compliment eachother. 

# Python_for_Data(optional Prework)
* A look at the applications used and why
* What can you do with Python? Why not learn R or SPSS Modeler?
* Basic setup covered in [DataScience101](https://github.com/Morrisdata/DataScience101)

# Python for Data
Download [Anaconda with python 3.6 or 7](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), Pycharm or code editor for exercises

WHY NOT 2.7?
- 2.7 until recently were better for learning, support and tutorials. 
- Learning 2.7 is still a huge value and is not terribly different in princple from 3. 
- Most programs you will be working with, debugging or modifying will be in 2.7
- Having both on your resume is fantastic.
