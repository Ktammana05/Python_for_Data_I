# Python for Data Workshop
This workshop is meant to help someone break into programming using Python and data. The material covered is in a crash course fashion 
and is by no means comprehensive the materials covered are a "best of". 

It is up to an individual to work with other courses outside of this workshop in order to get a full breadth of knowledge.  If you have not already heard of these resources and are new to python I would use them in conjunction with what you learn here as they compliment eachother.

|[Learn Python the Hardway walk through](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCHnubFzFwjJVEvQk-FuEynAuwGV_4BNS)|This is a great way to dig into deep basic syntax with a guide!|
|[Learn Python the Hardway](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/)|Remember that walkthrough video, try it without the video, gets a bit more real after about exercise 15.| 
|[Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python)|Repeat, repeat repeat, just another avenue to reinforce everything your learning|




# Python_for_Data(optional Prework)
* A look at the applications used and why
* What can you do with Python? Why not learn R or SPSS Modeler?
* Basic setup covered in [DataScience101](https://github.com/Morrisdata/DataScience101)

# Python for Data
Download [Anaconda 2.7](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), Pycharm or code editor for exercises
