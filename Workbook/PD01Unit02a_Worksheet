# IDENTIFIERS
''' I like to call these variables. 
there are a few rules that I may break for the sake of speed and training.'''
"""
Rules for identifiers

An identifier, also called a name, is a sequence of 
letters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9, _ ) 

Rules:
1)    cannot start with a number          003test
2)    cannot have a space in the name     test script
3)    cannnot have a symbol               test#
4)    Python is case sensitive, x is not the same as X 
5)    Avoid underscores _
      double underscores (for example, __init__) have built in use cases
    
Cannot use Reservered words
False      class      finally    is         raise
None       continue   for        lambda     return
True       def        from       nonlocal   try
and        del        global     not        while
as         elif       if         or         with
assert     else       import     pass       yield
break      except     in         print


Style guidelines for identifiers
use lower case for variables
use underscores_between_words
meaningful names, ie age is better than age. 
legible short hand while retaining meaning 
      average_age_of_shoppers could be avg_cust_age

# OBJECTS

Common error: Missing parentheses
It is a good practice to ensure you have explicitly put together your logic
using parentheses. In more complex logic it is easy to forget a parentheses
or lose track and have them set up incorrectly

## EXERCISE
'''
Initial Markup (IMU) is the difference between the cost and selling price of an 
item when it is first introduced for sale. 
It is also called Initial Mark On, Markon or Markup. 

The formula for this calculation is: 
Selling price â€“ cost = Initial Markup Dollars. 

If a buyer brings in a line of jeans with a cost of 25 per pair and initially 
prices them to sell at 55 per pair, the Initial Markup is 30. 

1)Create an IMU calculator so that you can enter the cost of an item the sale
price and see the result
2) using boolean logic evaluate that the price has not exceed a 20% markup
    expected out put: True or False'''

Create a function to evaluate IMU and suggest an action

Here is a list of what they are being sold for
Jean_price = 60

Create a function that evaluates the cost and the sell price
If it is over 14% bring back directions to "markdown"
If it is under 2% bring back directions to "markup"
If it is in range bring back directions to "keep same"

Bonus, can you add or subtract how much to markup or markdown to 
be within the parameters?

''' PROJECT EXERCISE
Revisit your previous project script and consider how you might use 
Prompts, If then else, Math, and boolean to update your 
scores, find your averages and give recommendations and what you can add to
your resume or what you need to practice.

Could you use input with If then else to create a Quiz? Maybe later you can
begin grading the quiz. A good starting point is to take what you have already 
created and use prompts to make your scores dynamic.
Beyond this is creativity design and your own ideas.
